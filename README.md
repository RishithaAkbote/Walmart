# Walmart
This project focuses on analyzing a Walmart dataset to derive insights about customer behavior, product preferences, and demographic influences on purchasing patterns. The analysis was performed using Python in Jupyter Notebook, and the final output, including code and results, is available in a PDF file exported from the notebook.

**Project Overview**
The primary goal of this project is to explore customer purchasing trends, analyze categorical and numerical variables, and calculate confidence intervals for various subgroups. The findings are translated into actionable business recommendations for Walmart.


**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
* Visualizing and cleaning the dataset.
* Analyzing the contribution of categorical variables.
* Understanding age group distribution across city categories.

**Statistical Analysis:**
* Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis.
* Correlation between categorical variables.
* Calculating confidence intervals for specific subgroups (e.g., gender, marital status, age groups).

**Key Business Insights:**
* Identifying high-spending customer segments.
* Understanding product preferences by demographic factors.

**Recommendations:**
Tailored strategies to improve customer retention and increase sales.

**Key Highlights**

**1. Data Analysis**
* Categorical Variables: Analyzed how variables like gender, marital status, and city category impact total purchase amounts.
* Age Group Distribution: Investigated spending patterns across different age groups.
* Purchase Value Analysis: Explored how purchase amounts vary among different demographic segments.

**2. Confidence Intervals (CI)**
* Calculated 90%, 95%, and 99% confidence intervals for:
* Average purchase amounts by gender.
* Average expenses for married vs. unmarried customers.
* Age group-wise average expenses.

**3. Actionable Insights and Recommendations**
* Male customers spend more per transaction than females; Walmart can target male customers with loyalty programs.
* Product Categories 1, 5, and 8 are the most frequently purchased. Focus on maintaining their quality and availability.
* Unmarried customers have higher spending; introducing targeted offers and promotions can increase engagement.
* Customers aged 26-35, particularly in city categories A and B, are high-value segments. Walmart should prioritize marketing efforts in these groups.
* Male customers in City Category C spend the most; targeted strategies in this category can increase revenue.
* Products in Categories 19, 20, and 13 have low sales. Walmart can consider discontinuing these products or rebranding them.

**Tools and Technologies Used**
Jupyter Notebook: For analysis and visualization.

**Python Libraries:**
* pandas for data manipulation.
* matplotlib and seaborn for visualization.
